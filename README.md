Trying to Edit this file through console. First attempt at coding, first attempt at a a webpage. Wish me luck. 

By the end of this I hope to be able to compile a basic webpage, navigate DevTools for existing browers, and use that knowledge to further my understanding of HTML, CSS and eventually JS. 

Update- Captain's Log:
If anyone is reading this, I already feel lost on this first project. Everything I spent the last week learning right out the window. Might have to go back over it. Pushing forward for now.
